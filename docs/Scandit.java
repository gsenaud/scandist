	 * <h2>Configuring Session Behaviour</h2>
	 *
	 * The scan session is responsible for determining the list of "relevant" barcodes
	 * by filtering out duplicates. Depending on your app, different duplicate removal
	 * is required. For some applications, only one barcode is required. The scanning
	 * process is stopped as soon as one code is decoded. For other applications,
	 * multiple codes are scanned after another. For example, a scanner at the cash
	 * desk may need to scan multiple products. To avoid duplicates, the same barcode
	 * should not be scanned in short succession. The same barcode (data, symbology)
	 * should not count as a duplicate if encountered again after a few seconds.
	 * <p>
	 * By default, if a barcode has the same symbology and data as code that was
	 * decoded less than 500ms ago, it is filtered out as a duplicate. The exact
	 * filtering behaviour can be changed by setting the "code duplicate filter", see
	 * {@link ScanSettings.setCodeDuplicateFilter} for details.
	 *
	 * <h2>Session Lifetime</h2>
	 *
	 * The session is cleared when either {@link BarcodePicker.startScanning} or ,
	 * {@link BarcodePicker.stopScanning} is called, or when the user manually clears
	 * the session using {@link clear}.
